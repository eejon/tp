# NAB User Guide

NAB is a **desktop app for NUS students to manage contacts across multiple modules, project groups, and CCAs, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NAB can help you organize and retrieve context-specific contacts and track commitments faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F08-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br><br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. <br>e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

    Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the address book.

   * `delete n/John Doe` : Deletes a contact with name 'John Doe' from the address book.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Can associate 0 or more tags during the add process
</box>

* Contact cannot be added if the added phone number is already registered in the address book

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] -- [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] [pfp/PHOTO_PATH]`

**Tip:** If there are multiple contacts with the same `NAME`, utilize the other optional parameters to narrow down the updating of the correct contact. This can be done by supplying any of the following information just after `edit n/NAME`: Phone number, Email, Address or Tag.

* The segment before `--` identifies which contact to edit.
* The segment after `--` specifies fields to be updated.
  * Updatable fields: `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ADDRESS`, `t/TAG`, `pfp/PHOTO_PATH`.
* `n/NAME` in the target segment is required.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* To add tags, you can specify new tags by typing `t/<tag>` in the updated field.
* To delete a specific tag, type an existing tag in the updated field.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Tags are case-insensitive.

Additional information for updating profile picture:
* For `pfp/PHOTO_PATH`, accepted file extensions are `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg`.
* `PHOTO_PATH` can be absolute (e.g., `C:/Users/Alex/Pictures/me.jpg`) or relative to the app folder (e.g., `images/me.png`).
* The file must exist; NAB will copy it into `data/images/`.

Examples:
*  `edit n/John Doe -- p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits John Doe's phone and email.
*  `edit n/John Doe p/98765432 -- n/Johnathan Doe t/teammate` uniquely identifies John Doe by phone, then updates name and tags.
*  `edit n/Betsy Crower -- t/` clears all tags for Betsy Crower.
*  `edit n/Alex Yeoh -- pfp/C:/Users/Alex/Pictures/profile.jpg` updates Alex Yeoh's profile picture.

Format: `find n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** If there are multiple contacts with the same `NAME`, utilize the other optional parameters to narrow down the
search to a specific contact.
</box>

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Order of parameters does not matter.

Examples:
* `find n/John` returns contacts named `John`
* `find n/John t/cs2106` returns contacts named `John` with tag `cs2106`

### Filtering persons by context : `filter`

Finds persons with the given tag(s).

Format: `filter t/TAG[, TAG]...`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `friend` will match `Friend` tag.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `frie` will not match `friend` tag.

Examples:
* `filter t/friends` finds all contacts that are tagged `friends`
* `filter t/cs2103, cs2105, cs2109s` finds all contacts that have any of these tags.

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** If there are multiple contacts with the same `NAME`, utilize the other optional parameters to narrow down the
deletion of the correct contact.
</box>

* The `NAME` is case-insensitive. e.g. `aLeX YeOH` will match `Alex Yeoh`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Alex Yeo` will not match `Alex Yeoh`
* Order of parameters does not matter.

Examples:
* `delete n/Alex Yeoh` deletes the contact with a matching name.

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
